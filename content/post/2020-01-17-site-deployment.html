<p>I encountered some problems deploying the new site on Netlify. While the site was building successfully locally, it was failing during the Netlify deployment. The root of the problem appears to be that I am running a later version of Hugo than the one used by Netlify as default.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, a quick search on the error code generated by the deployment report returned a very useful post by Alison Hill.</p>
<p>Fixed by providing a build configuration file as per instructions provided by Alison Hill at <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/" class="uri">https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/</a></p>
<p>Create a text file and then save the configuration file as <code>netlify.toml</code> in the root directory.</p>
<p>As soon as the config file was added, Netlify built the site successfully and it was published.</p>
