Hello and welcome to my new website. Having a decent personal blog has been on my to-do list for sometime but the list of requirements meant that it has taken a while to get things off the ground!

## The requirements

This project will build on my recent experience of statistical computing and software engineering using the R. To extend my learning I wanted to combine this experience with the development of a new personal website. The aim is three-fold: to document my learning, highlight some of the skills acquired, and show some applied examples.

The website is initially intended as a space for me to document my learning and highlight some of the skills and techniques I find useful in my work. As the site develops, it may also provide a place to showcase some of my applied research.

With these things in mind, the following list of platform requirements emerged:

- [x] A blog and pages for a personal website
- [x] Incorporate code examples from R environment easily
- [x] Ability to expand to showcase projects, papers etc.

## Implementation

Given the above, I was keen to learn how to blog and build websites using R Studio particularly as I now use the environment heavily in my day-to-day work. The Blogdown package seemed to fit the bill well, particularly given the use of R Markdown which I had been using on a recent project.

The Hugo-academic theme provides a great (and flexible) structure with which to build a simple initial site while allowing the site to expand to easily incorporate a number of research (and teaching) -based elements in the future.

Finally, I followed the recommendation to deploy the site through GitHub and Netlify.

## Work in progress

Much of the content of this site will be my learning around R and other tools and I suspect many of my early posts will be full of bugs. So please feel free to get in touch if something doesn't work, or you have any pointers!

I will be posting more on my experience building this site soon, but in the meantime, thanks for visiting.

Cheers, Tom.
