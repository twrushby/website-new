Thomas Rushby (MSc, PhD) is a researcher within the Sustainable Energy Research Group (Energy and Climate Change Division) at the University of Southampton.

Prior to joining the University of Southampton, Tom spent 10 years working in civil and structural engineering practice before completing a master’s degree in Architecture with a focus on energy, environment and sustainable development. 

Tom joined the University in 2010, initially working as a Research Engineer on an RCUK funded project – The role of Community-Based Initiatives in Energy Saving – before completing his PhD at the Univeristy of Southampton’s ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) under the interdisciplinary Energy, Environment and Resilience pathway.

While at the University, Tom has worked on a number of projects with a range of partners, gaining experience in a number of areas including large-scale fieldwork (trial design, implementation and management, trial evaluation) and data analytics and modelling (statistical analysis, microsimulation, spatial microsimulation).
